# ufldl-exercises

I'm going to keep this repository updated with the solutions I come up with as I work with Andrew Ng's tutorials, found <a href="http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial">here</a>.


Instead of <b>Matlab/Octave/R</b>, I chose to go with <b>Python/Numpy</b> and <b>Cuda/C</b>. Mainly because I like to code but also because I want to utilize the GPU on my laptop for large datasets.


<blockquote><b>This is a work in progress</b></blockquote>
